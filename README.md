Easily read/write metadata for mp3, m4a, ogg, flac. A simplified interface for Mutagen.



 * Use the same interface for different audio formats.
 
 * If writing to a file with no metadata, adds metadata instead of throwing exception.
 
 * Much easier to write tags in id3v2.3, for compat with Windows and smartphone apps.
 
 * Method to get the empirical ("actual") bitrate in addition to stated bitrate.
